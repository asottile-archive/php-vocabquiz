endogenous ligand - binding group from amino acids;
exogenous ligand - binding group from cofactors;
oxidase - oxidise substrate, reduce oxygen;
oxygenase - oxidise substrate, reduce oxygen, incorporates oxygen into substrate;
mono#oxygenase - adds a single oxygen to substrate;
internal mono#oxygenase - substrate reduces remaining oxygen that is not incorporated;
external mono#oxygenase - external reductant reduces remaining oxygen that is not incorporated;
intramolecular di#oxygenase - both oxygens are incorporated into substrate;
intermolecular di#oxygenase - one oxygen is incorporated into substrate, the other is incorporated into something else;
Iron heme enzymes - often oxidases and oxygenases, also important for oxygen transfer;
Iron non#heme enzymes - Often for oxygenase activity, including hydroxylations;
Iron Sulfur proteins - electron transfer proteins;
Type I Copper Protein - "Blue Copper" proteins.  mononuclear bound to Cys for electron transfer;
Type II Copper Protein - mono nuclear proteins that are usually oxygenases;
Type III Copper Protein - dinuclear proteins usually oxygenases and oxidases;
Trinuclear Copper Protein - copper protein usually for oxidase;
Zinc Finger - Protein for binding to DNA regions, metal ion does not really play role in biding;
Copper Export Regulator - example of protein which detects Cu+ to induce transcription of export protein;
Calmodulin - example of detection protein of second messenger;
