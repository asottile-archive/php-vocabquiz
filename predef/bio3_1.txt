population-a localized group of individuals that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring;
gene pool-total aggregate of genes in a population at any one time;
gene flow-additions or subtractions of alleles to gene pool;
hardy weinberg-principle that states the frequencies of genes after random mating;
genetic drift- unpredictable fluctuations in gene frequency;
founder event - group leaves a population and starts a new one;
bottleneck effect - most of a population dies resulting in a drop in diversity;
natural selection-Darwin's principle of descent with modification;
differential survival-overproduction of offspring than can live;
homology - similarities due to common descent;
directional selection - increases the frequency of an allele and decreases diversity;
stabilizing selection - decreases diversity of a trait while not changing its average value;
disruptive selection - increases genetic variation without changing the average trait value;
bateman trivers hypothesis - sexual selection is highest in sex that invests least in offspring;
point mutation - change in a single nucleotide;
synonymous substitution - mutation that does not change the amino acid;
non synonymous substitution - mutation that changes the amino acid;
somatic - cells that are not involved in reproduction;
germ - cells that are involved in reproduction;
anagenesis - accumulation of heritable changes altering the characteristcs of species (non branching);
cladogenesis - process by which a new species forms (branching);
allopatric speciation - geographic isolation causes a new species;
sympatric speciation - genetic divergence within a habitat due to nonrandom mating;
prezygotic isolation - restriction of reproduction due to incompatibility which prevents the formation of a child;
postzygotic isolation - restriction of the produced offspring to produce children because of incompatibility;
phylogeny - study of connections between organisms by ancestor relationships;
systematics - study of the diversity and relationships of organisms living and nonliving;
taxonomy - naming of species;
plesiomorphic - ancestral characteristics;
apomorphic - derived characteristics which are different among organisms;
homologous entities - structures and genes that are similar because of descent;
synapomorphic - shared derived changes among a group;
outgroup - group which is an ancestor that is a reference to lineage;
cladogram - shows branching relations of evolution;
homoplasious - similar structures but are evolved independently;
monophyletic - single origin of a group of species;
polyphyletic - a group of species has several origins;
paraphyletic - a group of species which have some shared origins but some unshared;
lytic generation - virus uses cell to multiply and then kills the host cell;
lysogenic generation - virus injects genes into host cell for replication;
binary fission - splitting of bacteria;
plasmid - individual genetic information particles in bacteria;
conjugation - transferring of plasmids in bacteria;
