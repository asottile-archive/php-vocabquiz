concerted model - Hb cooperativity where only exists in T or R;
sequential model - Hb cooperativity where there are hybridized T or R states;
Bohr effect - H+ concentration decreases oxygen binding in Hb;
BPG - binding to Hb leads to decreased oxygen binding;
Carbonate - binds to N terminus in Hb leading to decreased binding;
hemocyanin - copper oxygen binding factor;
hemorhythrin - non heme iron protein;
anemia - blood deficiency;
thessalemia - innability to synthesize heme;
Type I hemochromatosis - age induced iron excess;
Type II hemochromatosis - juvenile iron excess;
sickle cell anemia - leads to deoxy Hb fibrils;
malaria - goal is to steal heme;
heme oxidase - human enzyme to reduce free heme;
hemozoin - heme polymer in malaria parasite;
inert complex - slow ligand substitution;
labile complex - fast ligand substitution;
dissociative mechanism - SN1 like dissociation before addition (dependent on X(old ligand));
associative mechanism - SN1 like attack before dissocation (dependent on Y(new ligand));
rubredoxin - One sulfur FeS cluster;
entatic - strained tetrahedral;
Localized- FeS where extra electron is "trapped";
Fluctuating - FeS where extra electron measurably shifts between two Fes;
Delocalized - FeS where extra electron is on both Fes;
Rieske complex - 2Fe2S complex with 2 His, 2 Cys;
