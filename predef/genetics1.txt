polymorphism - differences between individuals;
forward genetics - genetics involving deriving phenotypes from genotypes;
reverse genetics - genetics involving deriving genotypes from phenotypes;
parental cross - crossing two parental individuals;
intercross - crossing two individuals that are siblings;
backcross - crossing an individual with their parental generation;
test cross - crossing an unknown individual with a recessive phenotype;
reciprocal cross - perform pair of crosses with genotypes switched with respect to gender;
hemizygous - containing only one copy of gene;
law of segregation - separation of alleles in gamete formation;
law of independent assortment - separation of different genes on different chromosomes;
heteroplasmic - contains multiple genotypes in mitochondria/chloroplasts within one cell;
maternal effects - effects observed in offspring due to mother's RNA/protein;
maternal inheritance - inheritance of chloroplasts/mitochondria;
chiasmata - crossing over event;
recombinant - non#parental type;
