non#virtual inheritance pattern - Using a ordinary method in an interface to make a virtual call;
abstract base class - class with at least one pure virtual function;
interface class - class that provides only only an interface that will be used polymorphically;
abstraction - separating implementation from interface;
encapsulation - protect implementation from interface;
fat interface - base class has many more virtual functions than any derived class will implement;
downcast - casting from base class to derived class;
upcast - casting from derived class to base class;
